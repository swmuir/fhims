	<p>This class represents actions performed on a specimen in order to prepare it for future testing.  Such actions may include adding an additive or placing the specimen in a container containing a pre-defined additive in order to preserve, maintain or enhance the particular nature or component of the specimen.  Other actions include aliquoting a single specimens into multiple subsets, grouping or pooling multiple specimens into one specimen, etc.  As a result of this processing event, a new specimen(s) may be created, thus this class contains a pointer (zero-to-many) back to the Specimen class to identify the newly-created Specimen(s).</p>

  <stentry><p>				&quot;The number of individual specimens of a particular type represented by this instance of a specimen. The use of this field is restricted to specimens upon which all specimen related attributes are identical. This field would only be valued if the [Specimen Role] attribute has the value [Group].&quot; - HL7 Version 2.8, SPM-13.

  <stentry><p>				Identifies Specimen instance(s) created as a result of a Specimen Processing Event.  Note the Id of the newly-created specimens are often derived from the Id of the original specimen.  For example, if a samply of whole blood with Id=1234 was spun into two new samples containing plasma (Id=1234-01) and platelets (Id=1234-02), two new Sample instances are created.
