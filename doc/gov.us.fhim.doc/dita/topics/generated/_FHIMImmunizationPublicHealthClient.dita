  <title>Description</title>
	<p>A Public Health Client is a Patient from the viewpoint of a Jurisdiction.  For example, John Doe lives in Arizona, and has been seen by two practices, whereby he is patient number 123 at practice A and patient number 456 at practice B.  The state of Arizona will assign a single id to John, say, XYZ.  This id (the recordId property of this class) is correlated to the ids from the two practices.  In other words, each patient will have a separate id and record at each medical practice, but will have one id at the jurisdictional level.</p>

  <stentry><p>				Identifies the Patient (from the Provider&apos;s point of view) that correlates to the Public Health Client record.  For example, John Doe lives in Arizona, and has been seen by two practices, whereby he is patient number 123 at practice A and patient number 456 at practice B.  The state of Arizona will assign a single id to John, say, XYZ.  The Public Health Client class will contain a recordId = XYZ.  This property points to Practice A, patientId=123, and Practice B, patientId=456.
