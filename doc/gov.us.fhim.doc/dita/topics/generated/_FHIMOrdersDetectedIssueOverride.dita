  <title>Description</title>
	<p>Provides a record that the Detected Issue (or &quot;Order Check&quot;) was acknowledged and was disregarded.  For example, perhaps a warning was displayed indicating that the patient has a mild allergy to an antibiotic that the clinician wishes to order.  If the antibiotic is the only one that could possibly save the patient&apos;s life, the clinician would likely choose to order the antibiotic anyway.</p>
