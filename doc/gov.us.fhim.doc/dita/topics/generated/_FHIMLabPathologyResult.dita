  <title>Description</title>
	<p>This class documents the results of a Pathology observation event.  Note that the VA makes a distinction between AnatomicalPathology, Cytopathology, ElectronMicroscopy, and SurgicalPathology, all of which are handled by this one class.  Also, a large portion of Autopy observations take the form of pathology reports.</p><p></p><p>Pathology results generally take the form of documents, which in turn are composed of sections containing free-form text.  The College of American Pathologists lists a number of sections that a well-formed pathology report should or may contain.  The Pathology Result class therefore is comprised of Lab Report Sections, the Section Title of which should come from some pre-defined vocabulary.  The report may also contain images and diagnoses.  It is noted that this entire structure could easily be replaced by a Clinical Document; in the future we may point to Clinical Document rather than maintain a separate Pathology Result structure.</p>
