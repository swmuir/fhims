When the encounter is &quot;completed&quot; this attribute contains the actual discharge disposition.

  <stentry><p>dischargeInstructions : <xref href="../t_FHIMPatientEducationPatientEducation.dita" >PatientEducation</xref> (0..*)</p></stentry>
  <stentry><p>				Pointer to a Patient Education record which documents the Act of the provision of instructions to the Patient upon the completion of an Encounter.  These instructions may be in the form of a pre-defined document that is specific to the Patient&apos;s condition or the Procedure which has undergone, or it may be in the form of free-form text, or both.  We point to the Patient Education class rather than simply having a discharge instructions string property so that data can be collected regarding who provided the instructions and when, as well as an indication of the patient&apos;s level of understanding.
