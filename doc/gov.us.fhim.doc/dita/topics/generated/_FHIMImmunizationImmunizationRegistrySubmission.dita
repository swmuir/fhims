  <title>Description</title>
	<p>The transmittal of Immunization information to a Immunization Information System (IIS), which are maintained by Public Health Jurisdictions.  Note that healthcare providers typically submit all known information regarding the Patient&apos;s immunization history to the IIS, not just those vaccinations that they performed themselves.  This is in order to ensure that as much information as possible is available to the IIS.  The IIS has the burden to de-duplicate records received from multiple providers.</p>
