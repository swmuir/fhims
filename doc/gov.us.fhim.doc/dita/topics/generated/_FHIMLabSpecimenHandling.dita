  <title>Description</title>
	<p>This class contains information regarding the transportation or storage of a specimen.  Information may be recorded for both storage and transportation about the minimum and maximum temperatures to which the specimen was exposed.  Subtypes of this class deal with specific requirements for storage and transportation.</p><p></p><p>Note that we need to model more details regarding chain of custody in general and the storage and handling of specimens in specific in future modeling iterations.  We may also need a shipping-container assessment, not just specimen assessment.</p>
