</stentry>
  <stentry><p>				This property uniquely identifies the question being asked within the Assessment Instrument.  This is treated as a code because the Name and Version of the Assessment Instrument plus the Question Number serves as an identifier, while the text of the question can be represented as the associated text.  For example, the Addiction Severity Index, 5th Edition question G.4 is the &quot;Date of Admission&quot;.
