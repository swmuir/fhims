	<p>A statement of a condition that must be met.  The evaluation of facts against a rule results in a value of true or false.  Rules can be evaluated by humans or by computers; this class is intended to contain rules that are human-readable as well as those that can be evaluated by a rules engine.  An example of a Rule would be that the second dose of a vaccine must be administered between six and eight weeks after the first dose.</p>
