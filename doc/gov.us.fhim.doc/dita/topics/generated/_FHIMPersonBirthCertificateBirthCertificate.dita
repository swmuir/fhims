  <title>Description</title>
	<p>&quot;A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a child.  Depending on the jurisdiction, a record of birth might or might not contain verification of the event by such as a midwife or doctor.  In the U.S., the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the states.  These forms are completed by the attendant at birth or a hospital administrator, which are then forwarded to a local or state registrar, who stores the record and issues certified copies upon request.  The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births. However, states are free to create their own forms. [adapted from wikipedia].  This class represents a Person&apos;s Birth Certificate, as defined by the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, Revision 11/2003.</p>
