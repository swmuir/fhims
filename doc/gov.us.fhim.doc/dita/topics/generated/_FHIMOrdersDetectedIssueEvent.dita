  <title>Description</title>
	<p>&quot;An observation identifying a potential adverse outcome as a result of an Act or combination of Acts.  Examples: Detection of a drug-drug interaction; Identification of a late-submission for an invoice; Requesting discharge for a patient who does not meet hospital-defined discharge criteria.  Discussion: This class is commonly used for identifying &apos;business rule&apos; or &apos;process&apos; problems that may result in a refusal to carry out a particular request. In some circumstances it may be possible to &apos;bypass&apos; a problem by modifying the request to acknowledge the issue and/or by providing some form of mitigation.  Constraints: the Act or Acts that may cause the the adverse outcome are the target of a subject ActRelationship. The subbtypes of this concept indicate the type of problem being detected (e.g. drug-drug interaction) while the Observation.value is used to repesent a specific problem code (e.g. specific drug-drug interaction id).&quot; - HL7 Version 3</p>

  <stentry><p>detectedIssueOverride : <xref href="../t_FHIMOrdersDetectedIssueOverride.dita" >DetectedIssueOverride</xref> (0..1)</p></stentry>
  <stentry><p>				Provides a record that the Detected Issue (or &quot;Order Check&quot;) was acknowledged and was disregarded.  For example, perhaps a warning was displayed indicating that the patient has a mild allergy to an antibiotic that the clinician wishes to order.  If the antibiotic is the only one that could possibly save the patient&apos;s life, the clinician would likely choose to order the antibiotic anyway.
