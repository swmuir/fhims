	<p>This class represents two properties that the DUE composite in the NCPDP SCRIPT standard has that the NCPDP Telecommunication standard does not.  In practice, this class&apos; two properties, along with the one property that the Telecommunication standard uniquely contains would likely be moved to the DUE superclass, and we could have modeled it that way, but we&apos;ve chosen to separate the subclasses in order to visually depict the differences between the two standards.</p>
