	<p>[US Standard Certificate Of Birth Field 54].  This class represents an abnormal condition of the newborn.  On the form, this is a multiple-choice question (i.e., &quot;check all that apply&quot;), although one of the choices is &quot;None of the above&quot;, so if that one is chosen, there should not be any others chosen.  Possible values include: Assisted ventilation required immediately following delivery; Assisted ventilation required for more than six hours; NICU admission; Newborn given surfactant replacement therapy; Antibiotics received by the newborn for suspected neonatal sepsis; Seizure or serious neurologic dysfunction; Significant birth injury (skeletal fractures(s), peripheral nerve injury, and/or soft tissue/solid organ hemorrhage which require intervention); None of the above.</p>
