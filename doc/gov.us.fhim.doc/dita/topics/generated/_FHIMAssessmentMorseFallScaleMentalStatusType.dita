	<p>&quot;Mental status: When using this Scale, mental status is measured by checking the patient&#8217;s own self-assessment of his or her own abilities. Ask the patient, &#8220;Are you able to go the bathroom alone or do you need assistance?&#8221; If the patient&#8217;s reply judging his or her own ability is consistent with the ambulatory nursing order, the patient is rated as &#8220;normal&#8221; and scored 0. If the patient&#8217;s response is not consistent with the nursing orders or if the patient&#8217;s response is unrealistic, then the patient is considered to overestimate his or her own abilities and to be forgetful of limitations and scored as 15.&quot; - LOINC</p>
