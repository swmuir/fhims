	<p>&quot;A factor that renders the administration of a drug or the carrying out of a medical procedure inadvisable.&quot; -  Stedman&apos;s Medical Dictionary.</p><p></p><p>Note that because almost all Contra-Indications are Health Concerns, for example, &quot;Allergy to Eggs&quot;, &quot;Allergy to Aluminum&quot;, &quot;Current fever with moderate-to-severe illness&quot;, the Contra-Indication is modeled as relationship to Health Concern, and the Contra-Indication code may be derived from the Health Concern code.  This having been said, there are some members of the Contra-Indication Value Set that are too general to point to a single Health Concern, even though they might still be derivable from the Health Concern list.  Examples include &quot;Chronic disease (disorder)&quot;, and &quot;Immunodeficiency due to any cause, including HIV (hematologic and solid tumors, congenital immunodeficiency, long-term immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids)&quot;.</p>
