	<p>An obligation policy may be used to specify additional privacy preferences specified by a client/patient. An obligation policy may be specified in addition to a ConstraintPolicy to fully describe a patient&apos;s access control preferences. In some cases an obligation policy may be used to indicate that the receiver of an information object may not be allowed to re-disclose it or persist that information object indefinitely. According to ISO 22600-2, ObligationPolicy instances &apos;are event-triggered and define actions to be performed by manager agent&apos;.</p>

  <stentry><p>				This attribute identifies the action required before completing the step in the workflow. We assume it is coded concept but in today&apos;s implementations it&apos;s primarily an ad-hoc rule reference (e.g., the name of a data base stored procedure). An obligation may be associated with the release of an object. For example, it may require a signature. This information is passed as rule for an application to enforce. In other cases it may require that an audit record be created.
