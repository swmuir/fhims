	<p>Functional Roles can be grouped according to their authorization to access IIHI and perform various operations on health care information. E.g., A health care provider in Organization A is authorized to access protected information (including IIHI) from Organization B (when Organization A &amp;amp;amp;amp; B have entered into a trusted relationship) if that provider is associated with the Functional Group whose permissions grant access per that FunctionalRole. In summary, the functional role defines the access control decision. A functional role is bound to a policy. </p>
