      <p> The purpose of this review is to identify the data elements required for the
         interoperable exchange for the BirthCertificate domain including dependencies. A column is
         provided at the far right of the table for you to enter comments related to each
         data element. If the class or domain is missing data elements, please add a row
         at the bottom of the sheet and specify a name, description, and type of data
         (e.g. numeric, string, date/time, code). 
      </p>
      <p> Once you have reviewed the data elements, please review the value sets
         associated with the coded data elements. Please provide feedback by adding
         comments in the column provided at the right of item/row or by adding rows at
         the bottom table. For any new coded concepts without a valid code yet, our team
         will propose them for addition in the source coding system.

            <td colspan="1" style="font-size:12px" valign="top"> <p>&quot;A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a child.  Depending on the jurisdiction, a record of birth might or might not contain verification of the event by such as a midwife or doctor.  In the U.S., the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the states.  These forms are completed by the attendant at birth or a hospital administrator, which are then forwarded to a local or state registrar, who stores the record and issues certified copies upon request.  The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births. However, states are free to create their own forms. [adapted from wikipedia].  This class represents a Person&apos;s Birth Certificate, as defined by the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, Revision 11/2003.</p></td>
